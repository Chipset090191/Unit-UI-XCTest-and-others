### Project `DeliciousMeal` and Unit\UI Tests by using XCTest framework.
Here I am gonna just share with you some basic techniques for testing your apps. I have covered not all my `DeliciousMeal` application with tests rather sensitive main parts of my app. 

1. Unit tests.

lets just start with unit tests. And on this step I am sure you know how to add a target with Unit XCTest framework to your appüòÅ.
Ok open project `DeliciousMeal` and there file - [UnitTests](https://github.com/Chipset090191/Unit-UI-XCTest-and-others/blob/main/DeliciousMeal%20with%20tests/UnitTests/UnitTests.swift).

So as my app getting the data from the internet the method `decode` is supposed to be tested. I wrote down test in `testDataFromTheInternet` method to be certain my 10 menu images are gotten from net. And here to be sure that everything is ok we use comand from XCTest framework with our condition: `XCTAssertTrue(menu.count == 10)`. Notice that I created `var menu: [Menu] = []` right before test to assing the result of decode func so as in real code.
### Pic #1
```swift
  func testDataFromTheInternet() throws {
        // made preparations for test
        var menu: [Menu] = []
        
        menu = try Bundle.main.decode(fileName: "Menu.json")
        
        // here we simply assert that we`ve gotten the full list of images
        XCTAssertTrue(menu.count == 10)
    }
```
To run test you should click on rhombus next to your func name. So as you can see on `Pic #2` we`ve passed our test) succesfully with indicator ‚úÖ. Also from right side there is a number - 1 that indicates number of calls for this method.
### Pic #2

When our test has passed we can dive deeply in statistics as you may look on `Pic #3`. Just click `Show report navigator icon-button` to open it. In this tree you are able to analize the speed of block executions and test coverage. 
### Pic #3
<div align="center">
<img width="1667" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 11 04 12‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/904b1d10-a5a2-423f-9b4e-7444f9c1e31c" />
</div>

Lets just check out how our decode function is covered inside. To do that click on file `Bundle-decodable.swift`.  So on `Pic #4` with green color we know that our func was called two times where guard block found `url` and no error wasn`t there, means lines with red color were not run. That is good.
### Pic #4

Ok, I show you ability how to observe statistics when you are on testing. Now you know it.

In Unit tests we have got one more sensitive async method which is responsible for final step where we get our order accepted by food-server. we test this in `testorderAcceptance`. 
Lets look at this closer. We still stay on file - [UnitTests](https://github.com/Chipset090191/Unit-UI-XCTest-and-others/blob/main/DeliciousMeal%20with%20tests/UnitTests/UnitTests.swift).

Now, in this case I make some preparations. By the way there are two methods which are called every time before test run `setUpWithError()` and when it is finished `tearDownWithError()`. Ok, step by step:
- I declare `checkoutVC` in `final class UnitTests: XCTestCase {}` and instanciate it in `setUpWithError()` every time when test starts. I do so because necessity applying to `placeOrder()` async method to make tests;
- So as my `placeOrder()` is async func I mark my `testorderAcceptance()` as async;
- Inside `testorderAcceptance()` I fill address, city, phone for textFields on CheckoutViewController so that our guards would work positively.
- Then I call `await checkoutVC.placeOrder()` and assert the result is not `Nil` in `await checkoutVC.placeOrder()`. So actually we have done. But finally, to make sure the data is correct I assert the last thing and compare the name of dish that was previously set to `TestDish` and data I have got from server `XCTAssertEqual(myOrder.orderName, checkoutVC.nameOfDish)`.
```swift

 var checkoutVC: CheckoutViewController!
    
    override func setUpWithError() throws {
        checkoutVC = CheckoutViewController()
    }


@MainActor
    func testorderAcceptance() async throws {

        checkoutVC.nameOfDish = "TestDish"
        checkoutVC.addressTextField.text = "TestAddress"
        checkoutVC.cityTextField.text = "TestCity"
        checkoutVC.phoneTextField.text = "TestPhone"
        
        await checkoutVC.placeOrder()
        
        XCTAssertNotNil(checkoutVC.acceptedOrder)
        
        if let myOrder = checkoutVC.acceptedOrder {
            XCTAssertEqual(myOrder.orderName, checkoutVC.nameOfDish)
        }
    }
```
