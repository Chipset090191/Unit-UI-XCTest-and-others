### Project `DeliciousMeal` and Unit\UI Tests by using XCTest framework.
Introduction to App Testing
In this section, I‚Äôll walk you through some foundational techniques for testing iOS applications. While I haven‚Äôt written tests for every single feature of my `DeliciousMeal` app, I have focused on covering the most critical and sensitive components. 

### Unit tests.
### Step 1: Setting Up Unit Tests

We‚Äôll begin with unit testing. I assume you‚Äôre already familiar with adding a Unit Test target to your Xcode project using the XCTest frameworküòÅ.
To get started:
- Open my DeliciousMeal project in Xcode;
- Locate and open the file - [UnitTests](https://github.com/Chipset090191/Unit-UI-XCTest-and-others/blob/main/DeliciousMeal%20with%20tests/UnitTests/UnitTests.swift).

### Step 2: Testing Data Decoding from the Internet

Since `DeliciousMeal` retrieves data from the internet, one of the most crucial methods to test is the `decode` function, which processes the incoming data. I created a unit test method named `testDataFromTheInternet` to validate this behavior. Specifically, this test ensures that the app successfully fetches and decodes 10 menu images from the internet.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
- Before the test, I define a variable:
```swift
var menu: [Menu] = []
```
- I then assign the result of the `decode` method to this `menu` variable;
- To confirm that the decoding works correctly and all 10 items are fetched, I use the `XCTAssertTrue` function from the `XCTest` framework with the following condition:
```swift
XCTAssertTrue(menu.count == 10)
```  
This full code of the test on `Pic #1` ensures the integrity of the decoding process and verifies that our app retrieves the expected number of menu items.

### Pic #1
```swift
  func testDataFromTheInternet() throws {
        // made preparations for test
        var menu: [Menu] = []
        
        menu = try Bundle.main.decode(fileName: "Menu.json")
        
        // here we simply assert that we`ve gotten the full list of images
        XCTAssertTrue(menu.count == 10)
    }
```

### Step 3: Running the Unit Test

To execute your test method, simply click on the diamond-shaped icon (rhombus) located next to the function name in the editor. This will run the specific test case individually. As shown in `Pic #2`, the test passed successfully, indicated by the green ‚úÖ symbol. This visual confirmation means the `decode` method is functioning as expected for the scenario being tested.
Additionally, on the right side of the test result, you‚Äôll notice a number ‚Äî in this case, 1. This number represents the number of times the test method has been executed during the current session. It can be helpful for tracking execution counts, especially when diagnosing test flakiness or reruns.

</div>

### Step 4: Analyzing Test Results and Performance Metrics

Once your test has passed, you can explore detailed statistics and performance insights. As illustrated in `Pic #3`, click on the `Show Report Navigator` button in Xcode (located in the left sidebar, typically represented by a speech bubble icon).

This opens the Report Navigator, where you can:
- Review test execution logs;
- Analyze the performance of individual code blocks;
- Monitor execution time for each step;
- Check test coverage to see which parts of your code were actually exercised during testing.
This deeper level of analysis is particularly useful for identifying bottlenecks, optimizing performance, and ensuring that your tests are effectively covering the most important parts of your codebase.

</div>

Now, let‚Äôs take a closer look at how the decode function is covered during testing.

To do this:

1. Open the file `Bundle-decodable.swift` in Xcode;
2. With code coverage enabled, you‚Äôll see visual indicators directly in the gutter of your code (refer to `Pic #4`).
Here‚Äôs what the colors mean:

- `Green` lines indicate code that was executed during testing. In our case, the green lines show that the decode function was called twice, and the execution successfully passed through the guard block, meaning a valid URL was found and no error occurred.
- `Red` lines represent code that was not executed. This usually highlights alternate branches such as error handling or edge cases that didn't occur during the test run.
In this context, seeing the red lines in the error-handling path is actually a positive sign ‚Äî it means our test scenario didn‚Äôt trigger any failures, which aligns with expected behavior.

Ok, I show you ability how to observe statistics when you are on testing. Now you know it.

In Unit tests we have got one more sensitive async method which is responsible for final step where we get our order accepted by food-server. we test this in `testorderAcceptance`. 
Lets look at this closer. We still stay on file - [UnitTests](https://github.com/Chipset090191/Unit-UI-XCTest-and-others/blob/main/DeliciousMeal%20with%20tests/UnitTests/UnitTests.swift).

Now, in this case I make some preparations. By the way there are two methods which are called every time before test run `setUpWithError()` and when it is finished `tearDownWithError()`. Ok, step by step:
- I declare `checkoutVC` in `final class UnitTests: XCTestCase {}` and instanciate it in `setUpWithError()` every time when test starts. I do so because necessity applying to `placeOrder()` async method to make tests;
- So as my `placeOrder()` is async func I mark my `testorderAcceptance()` as async;
- Inside `testorderAcceptance()` I fill address, city, phone for textFields on CheckoutViewController so that our guards would work positively.
- Then I call `await checkoutVC.placeOrder()` and assert the result is not `Nil` in `await checkoutVC.placeOrder()`. So actually we have done. But finally, to make sure the data is correct I assert the last thing and compare the name of dish that was previously set to `TestDish` and data I have got from server `XCTAssertEqual(myOrder.orderName, checkoutVC.nameOfDish)`.
```swift

 var checkoutVC: CheckoutViewController!
    
    override func setUpWithError() throws {
        checkoutVC = CheckoutViewController()
    }


@MainActor
    func testorderAcceptance() async throws {

        checkoutVC.nameOfDish = "TestDish"
        checkoutVC.addressTextField.text = "TestAddress"
        checkoutVC.cityTextField.text = "TestCity"
        checkoutVC.phoneTextField.text = "TestPhone"
        
        await checkoutVC.placeOrder()
        
        XCTAssertNotNil(checkoutVC.acceptedOrder)
        
        if let myOrder = checkoutVC.acceptedOrder {
            XCTAssertEqual(myOrder.orderName, checkoutVC.nameOfDish)
        }
    }
```
